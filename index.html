<h3>About</h3>
<p>The new way of creating theatre. Different people. Different cultures. Different Dynamics</p>
<p> Settings define us and a new way of thinking! We want to create theatre and video that changes the 
    game that enables people to think and to make their own outcomes and decisions.
</p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>We have so many new opportunities and we want to work closely with people from 
    other backgrounds who may not have access to theatre and making their voices 
    heard.
